Weather Forecast App Project Overview
Project Purpose:

  The Weather Forecast App provides current weather information for any city entered by the user. It uses the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch and display weather data in a visually appealing manner.

Technologies Used:

HTML: To structure the content of the app.
CSS: To style the app, making it user-friendly and visually attractive.
JavaScript: To handle user input, fetch data from the API, and update the webpage dynamically.

Project Files:

index.html: Contains the basic structure of the app, including input fields and buttons.
styles.css: Provides the styling for the app, including layout, colors, and fonts.
scripts.js: Contains the logic for fetching weather data from the API and updating the DOM.

Features:

User Input: Allows users to input a city name.

API Integration: Fetches real-time weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API.
Dynamic Content: Displays the weather information, including temperature, weather description, humidity, and pressure.
Responsive Design: Ensures the app looks good on various screen sizes.
Error Handling: Displays error messages if the city name is invalid or if there are issues with the API.

How It Works:

  The user enters a city name and clicks the "Get Weather" button.
  The app sends a request to the OpenWeatherMap API with the city name.
  The API responds with the current weather data.
  The app displays the weather data, including temperature, weather conditions, humidity, and pressure.
  If there's an error (e.g., invalid city name), an error message is displayed.
  This overview provides a summary of the Weather Forecast App project, highlighting its purpose, technologies used, features, and how it works.
